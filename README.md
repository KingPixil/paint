# Paint

Minimal Library for JS

# Usage

Use it just like JQuery, as Paint is an extremely small, dead-simple version of it. For modern browsers.

### Method Requests

If you ever want a method that comes with JQuery, request it in the issues, I will consider adding it!

# Credits
Paints' core fn compiler file is built on top of [cash](https://github.com/kenwheeler/cash), but the rest was recoded recently to support more browsers. (Full Recode, deleted all files, and started froms scratch)
