# Paint

Minimal Library for JS

# Usage

Use it just like JQuery, as Paint is an extremely small, dead-simple version of it. For modern browsers.

### Method Requests

If you ever want a method that comes with JQuery, request it in the issues, I will consider adding it!

# Credits
Paint is built on top of [psQuery](https://github.com/pseudosavant/psQuery), but will shrink down to save some bytes.
